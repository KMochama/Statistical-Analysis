## Effects of Mindfulness on Anxiety and Cognitive Load in Nursing Learners

Project Overview:
The "STAI-NASA-TLX" project evaluates state anxiety and cognitive load among nursing learners during simulation-based learning (SBL) sessions. Using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), this study measures the effectiveness of mindfulness-based activities (MBAs) in reducing anxiety and cognitive load.

Key Features:

Data Collection:

Data was collected from nursing learners both before and after the intervention.
Collected data included self-reported anxiety levels and cognitive load across dimensions such as mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration.
Reverse Scoring and Total Calculation:

STAI responses were reverse scored where necessary, and total scores for both pre-and post-intervention were computed to assess anxiety levels.
Descriptive Statistics:

Detailed descriptive statistics for NASA-TLX subscales were provided, offering insights into the cognitive load experienced by learners during SBL sessions.
Inferential Statistical Analysis:

Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Tests were performed to compare pre-and post-intervention scores.
Effect sizes were calculated to determine the practical significance of observed changes.
Correlation Analysis:

The relationships between changes in STAI scores and NASA-TLX subscales were explored to understand the interaction between anxiety and cognitive load.
Visualizations:

Various visualizations, including histograms, Q-Q plots, box plots, and scatter plots, were generated to illustrate the data distribution and relationships.
Technologies Used:

R Programming Language: Utilized for data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
Libraries: Packages such as ggplot2, dplyr, and stats were key in executing the analyses and generating visualizations.
Project Outcome:
The project provided significant insights into the efficacy of mindfulness-based activities in reducing anxiety and cognitive load among nursing learners. These findings contribute to improving nursing education through evidence-based interventions, potentially enhancing clinical reasoning, judgment, and overall learner performance in clinical settings.

Attachments:

Visualizations: Including but not limited to STAI-NASA-TLX correlations, box plots, histograms, and Q-Q plots.
CSV Files: Detailed results such as STAI t-test, NASA-TLX descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis data.
This project showcases the critical role of MBAs in managing cognitive load and anxiety, ultimately contributing to better educational outcomes and preparedness in nursing education.
